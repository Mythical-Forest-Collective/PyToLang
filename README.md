# PyToLang
This project exists to attempt to bridge the gap between Python and other languages, meaning Python can be transpiled to Lua, Java (potentially), and other possible languages!

## Goals
Here is a set of goals we hope to each! They will have a ~~strikethrough~~ (strikethrough) when completed!

### Potential Lanuage Targets
 - Lua (5.1, specifically so we can target ComputerCraft, but more can be added!)
 - Java (Likely targeting the latest stable version if this *does* get worked on!)

## Why?
Simple my fellow (non-)asker, because we're bored!

## We?
We're a system and are open about it, read https://morethanone.info for information about it!

## Stop filling up the README!
Never!
